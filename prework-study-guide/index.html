        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Inside the head element, the following metadata tags are used:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
              <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
              <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
              <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
              <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
              <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
              <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
            <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
            <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag referes only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <li>Metadata is data about the webpage that the browswer uses to effectively serve the webpage to users.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. It is accessed by using Git commands in the command line, such as</li>
          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git add -A: uses the add command to add modifications in the current working branch to the staging area and the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
            <li>git commit -m "commit message": creates a commit to the current working branch and attaches a commit message</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: the pull command receives a branch's modifications into the local environment; the origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo; the main keyword indicates the branch</li>
            <li>git push origin branch-name: the push command pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch; when using the push command new remote branches can be created or new changes to existing branches can be added</li>
