        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Inside the head element, the following metadata tags are used:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
              <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
              <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
              <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
              <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
              <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
              <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
            <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
            <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag referes only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <li>Metadata is data about the webpage that the browswer uses to effectively serve the webpage to users.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
            <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page and will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>An external style sheet is the most commmon way to style a webpage and allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, the file is linked using a link element placed in the HTML's head. </li>
          </ul>
          <li>CSS Rules</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>Combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want aroudn the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. It is accessed by using Git commands in the command line, such as</li>
          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git add -A: uses the add command to add modifications in the current working branch to the staging area and the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
            <li>git commit -m "commit message": creates a commit to the current working branch and attaches a commit message</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: the pull command receives a branch's modifications into the local environment; the origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo; the main keyword indicates the branch</li>
            <li>git push origin branch-name: the push command pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch; when using the push command new remote branches can be created or new changes to existing branches can be added</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The var keyword is used to declare a variable.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>An array is a single variable taht is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
            <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data.</li>
            <li>To look at individual data items inside an array, the location of the data item in the array is needed. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>The console.log method is used to help developers test their code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops are used to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>When the computer encounters and if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.</li>
              <li>If the condition is falsy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
              <li>More than one condition can be provided by using else if to add on to an if statement.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A for loop uses a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>It contains the following three important statements:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The first statement determines the starting point for the loop.</li>
                <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.</li>
                <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A function is different is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. The function later needs to be called upon.</li>
            <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword.</li>
            <li>A functions name is followed by parentheses.</li>
          </ul>
